statistics in the FIFA World Cup Final. The game is repeated until your
favorite soccer team (country) wins the Final in a tournament, or until a
maximum number of tournaments are played. All statistics are displayed such as
number of goals scored per team per match, the team that scored to most goals in a 
tournament...
The purpose of this assignment is to help you learn primitive type single
arrays, multi-dimensional arrays and use of the random library.
